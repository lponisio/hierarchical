Bayesian methods are well suited to eliminate the many (nuisance) parameters in these complicated models; in this paper we investigate Bayesian methods for model checking. Since we contemplate model checking as a preliminary, exploratory analysis, we concentrate on objective Bayesian methods in which careful specification of an informative prior distribution is avoided. Numerous examples are given and different proposals are investigated and critically compared.},

The ergodicity of the resulting non-Markovian sampler is proved, and the efficiency of the combination is demonstrated with various examples. We present situations where the combination outperforms the original methods: adaptation clearly enhances efficiency of the delayed rejection algorithm in cases where good proposal distributions are not available. Similarly, delayed rejection provides a systematic remedy when the adaptation process has a slow start.},

	abstract = {There is an explosion of interest in Bayesian statistics, primarily because recently created computational methods have finally made Bayesian analysis tractable and accessible to a wide audience. Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, A Tutorial Introduction with R and {BUGS}, is for first year graduate students or advanced undergraduates and provides an accessible approach, as all mathematics is explained intuitively and with concrete examples. It assumes only algebra and 'rusty' calculus. Unlike other textbooks, this book begins with the basics, including essential concepts of probability and random sampling. The book gradually climbs all the way to advanced hierarchical modeling methods for realistic data. The text provides complete examples with the R programming language and {BUGS} software (both freeware), and begins with basic programming examples, working up gradually to complete programs for complex analyses and presentation graphics. These templates can be easily adapted for a large variety of students and their own research needs.The textbook bridges the students from their undergraduate training into modern Bayesian methods.-Accessible, including the basics of essential concepts of probability and random sampling -Examples with R programming language and {BUGS} software -Comprehensive coverage of all scenarios addressed by non-bayesian textbooks- t-tests, analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) and comparisons in {ANOVA}, multiple regression, and chi-square (contingency table analysis). -Coverage of experiment planning -R and {BUGS} computer programming code on website -Exercises have explicit purposes and guidelines for accomplishment},

The decision theoretic assumptions on which these methods are based are not always clearly stated in the original articles, however. The aim of this survey is to provide a unified review of Bayesian predictive model assessment and selection methods, and of methods closely related to them. We review the various assumptions that are made in this context and discuss the connections between different approaches, with an emphasis on how each method approximates the expected utility of using a Bayesian model for the purpose of predicting future data.},
